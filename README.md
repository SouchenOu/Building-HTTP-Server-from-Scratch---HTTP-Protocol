# Building-HTTP-Server-from-Scratch---HTTP-Protocol
42 project, recoding our own web server in C++. A program capable of running an HTTP server, handling requests, and parsing configuration files.



Creating a web server in C++ is a great way to learn the language and gain experience in web development. It is a relatively simple process that requires a few basic steps. First, you will need to create a socket to listen for incoming connections. Then, you will need to bind the socket to a port and start listening for incoming requests. Finally, you will need to write the code to handle the requests and send back the appropriate response. With these steps, you can create a basic web server in C++.
